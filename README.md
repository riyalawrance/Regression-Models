# Regression-Models
## Description
This contain a simple linear regression model and two polynomial regression models of degree 2 and 3.The R^2(coefficient of detrmination) and SSE(sum of squared errors) are also calculated for the respective models. It is implemented using python built-in functions in jupyter notebook

### Libraries used
The list of libraries used are mentioned below:
- numpy
- matplotlib
- pandas
- train_test_split from sklearn.model_selection
- LinearRegression from sklearn.linear_model
- PolynomialFeaturesfrom sklearn.preprocessing
- r2_score from sklearn.metrics
